    <p>
        <em>How To Train Your Dragon (2010)</em> - Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life.
        His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Gerard Butler) is chief of the clan.
        Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.

    <p>
        <em>How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)</em> - Five years have passed since Hiccup and Toothless united the dragons and Vikings of Berk.
        Now, they spend their time charting the island's unmapped territories. During one of their adventures, the pair discover a secret cave that houses hundreds of wild dragons -- and a mysterious dragon rider who turns out to be Hiccup's long-lost mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett).
        Hiccup and Toothless then find themselves at the center of a battle to protect Berk from a power-hungry warrior named Drago.
